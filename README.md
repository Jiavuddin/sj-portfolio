## Introduction

This portfolio website is built using ReactJS, featuring a clean and responsive design. It includes several key features to enhance user experience, such as a dynamic light/dark theme, a unique loader, and seamless navigation through various sections.

## App Level Functionalities

- **Light/Dark Theme:**
  - The application supports a dynamic light/dark theme.
  - The default theme is based on the user's system theme and persists across reloads.
  - Users can manually switch between light and dark themes, overriding the system theme.

- **Loader:**
  - A custom-designed loader provides a visually appealing experience during page loading.

- **Navigation:**
  - The navigation bar facilitates easy access to different sections: Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact.
  - A footer includes links to various profiles: Github, Gitlab, LinkedIn, Leetcode, YouTube, and a dedicated Resume page.

## Detail Page Explanation

### Home Page

- Displays a personalized greeting, name, and roles with a typewriter effect.
- Includes an image of the system setup, a plant, and a coffee, enhancing the user's connection to the developer.

### About Me Page

- Three concise paragraphs introducing myself.
- A section detailing my tech stack, work experience, education, and completed courses.

### Projects Page

- Lists projects with images and overlays that provide project details on hover.
- Clicking on a project navigates to a detailed project page with project title, description, GIF, technical insights, live link, credentials, and Github repo link.

### Resume Page

- A brief description of myself with links to the contact page and options to view or download my resume.
- Includes an image of my resume.

### Contact Page

- A one-liner allowing users to directly email me.
- A form for users to provide their name, email, and a message.
  - Utilizes a third-party service to validate email addresses.
  - Sends an email to the developer upon successful submission, and simultaneously, the user will receive an autogenerated email.
  - Provides appropriate notifications for success, invalid email, or service unavailability.
